        Liquidity pools (LPs) are crowdsourced pools of tokens which are often designed to incentivize staking by
        offering rewards. $BERRIES can be staked in liquidity pools #2 and #3 to earn additional $BERRIES. The portion
        of extra $BERRIES you receive is determined by how many tokens you stake relative to the whole pool.
        <br /> <br />
        Stakers in LP #2 earn a portion of the 15,000 $BERRIES emitted each day. Participating in LP #2 requires
        purchasing LP tokens by combining equal amounts of $BERRIES and ETH. The amount of ETH needed to make one LP
        token is relative to the market price of $BERRIES at the time you purchase the LP token. For additional
        instructions on how to do this, see ðŸ“–â”‚staking-tutorials.
        <br /> <br />
        Stakers in LP #3 earn a portion of the 3,000 $BERRIES emitted each day. Participating in LP #3 is less risky and
        cheaper than LP #2 in that it only requires staking $BERRIES, but in turn the rewards are reduced.
